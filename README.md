# Sudoku
I want to write a simple application to solve (an easy) sudoku.

I thought about how to solve a sudoku, so I started implementing the methods according to how I manually proceed in solving a sudoku.
I started by hardcoding an easy sudoku so that I had a "Sudoku to solve" and the solution, in order to verify my solution.
